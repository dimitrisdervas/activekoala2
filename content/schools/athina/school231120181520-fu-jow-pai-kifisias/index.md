&quot;When the Student is ready, the Teacher shall appear.&quot; - Chinese proverb

The School of Martial Arts has been operating at Politia Tennis Club for 14 consecutive years. A large number of students have been awarded in National and Open Championships through the school. Head of school is Mr. George Kalimeris, with over 30 years of experience. He is an acknowledged coach of martial arts by the General Secretariat for Sports, 5th Degree holder in the Chinese martial art of Fu Jow Pai and vice-president Panhellenic Association Fu Jow Pai. Learning Fu Jow Pai from childhood contributes to mixed lateralization of the brain and the right education, passing on positive messages in the subconscious of children. At the same time, the child develops internal discipline and acquires standards for life. People of all ages who expect to combine gymnastics within the principles of Fu Jow Pai are expected. The courses are delivered in a specially designed room that serves the needs of students to the maximum.
