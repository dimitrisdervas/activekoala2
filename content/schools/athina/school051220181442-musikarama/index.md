Welcome to Musikarama!! We are a Spanish registered association, currently operating in Athens, Greece, where thousands of refugees are awaiting for months in an uncertain situation, especially ever since countries such as Macedonia, Eslovenia or Croatia shut their borders in March 2016. This measure, with the approval of the European Union, was an attempt to shut the route for migrants trying to reach their destinations in northern Europe. However, this has only worsened their situation, forcing most of them to remain in Greece or attempt illegal ways of reaching other countries. After two years following up on this issue, and given the lack of response and right measures taken by the European authorities, we decided to take part and do our bit in this humanitarian crisis. In this initial stage, and after some months of research, we have clearly observed the main need we have observed is the lack of occupation in which most of children and adults find themselves day to day . Mostly for children, there are volunteers and organisations putting in place different activities. However, in most cases this is not enough to make their lives feel as “normal” as it once was, nor to fulfil their educational needs. Regarding the youth and adults, their most recurrent claim is that of work. There is a real lack of offer in this sense, which leads them to boredom and tiredness, sometimes also resulting in different tensions within the community. In addition, given that their basic needs are covered, to a greater or lesser extent by international organisations or self-organised groups and volunteers, we strongly believe it is in this scenario where other types of assistance and support are strongly needed. We would therefore love to help bringing back some joy and entertainment for children and adults too!.
