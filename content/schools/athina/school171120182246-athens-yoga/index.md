Athens Yoga is a Yoga Alliance Registered Yoga School (RYS®s), founded by Maja Zilih and Miltos Pavlou

Maja Zilih teaches over 500 classes yearly integrating different styles of yoga. Her method combines dynamism with meditative and mindful approach to asana, links movement with inner awareness, and always inspires students to approach yoga as a way of life. Athens Yoga offers yoga and meditation classes, seminars, teacher trainings and yoga retreats. It gathers and supports the ever larger community of yogis in Greece: students and teachers of yoga who share the path of yogic living, deep inner healing through yoga and meditation, and the vision of bringing about positive change in the world. Athens Yoga engages regularly in voluntary projects that support vulnerable groups.
